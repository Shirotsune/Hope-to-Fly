Hope to Fly (GAMEJAM 2015 - ASM2015)


#Very big thanks to the following people that I couldn't have done this project without 

Maria Vilko - Graphics
Mystran - Audio

# I will clean up the game code a little bit after ASM2015 on better time. The main goal of receiving playable demo was the main priority. I noticed as I was getting more and more tired, the engine structure started to feel more and more of black magic. This is against the well designed quality and mock I had planned to go with. I learned a lot and it was fun!
